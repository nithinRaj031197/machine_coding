### Q1: Explain the difference between **proto** and prototype in JavaScript.

- **`__proto__`** : It points to prototype of an object and is used for inheritance and accessing the prototype chain.

- **`prototype`** : It exists on constructor functions to setup inheritance for objects created by that function, defining shared properties and methods for instances.
